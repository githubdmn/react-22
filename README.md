The first project (Feedback App) is structured in a way 
so I can explain the fundamentals such as 
components, 
hooks, 
props, 
state, 
etc in a way that beginners can understand. 

The second project (Github Finder) will show 
you how to work with 3rd party APIs 
and the third project (House Marketplace) is a larger app 
that uses Firebase 9 and includes 
authentication, 
Firestore queries, 
file storage and more.

The final project has been added! 
It is a fullstack MERN support ticket 
system that uses Redux and Redux Toolkit.
